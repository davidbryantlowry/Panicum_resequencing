Panicum_resequencing
====================

This repository contains scripts that were used to analyze whole genome resequencing data of Panicum hallii.

Most of the scripts were orignially written by Kyle Hernandez and deposited 
at https://github.com/kmhernan/tacc-launcher-bio/tree/master/rad-pipeline

I have modified the scripts that were written for analyzing RAD data to deal with larger
whole genome resequencing data.
